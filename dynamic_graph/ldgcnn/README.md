# Linked Dynamic Graph CNN: Learning through Point Cloud by Linking Hierarchical Features

<img src='./LDGCNN_architecture.png' width=800>

We propose a linked dynamic graph CNN (LDGCNN) to classify and segment point cloud directly. We remove the transformation network, link hierarchical features from dynamic graphs, freeze feature extractor, and retrain the classifier to increase the performance of LDGCNN.

We have also uploaded the code and data to the codeocean and prepared the environment to run the code. You can run the code online and reproduce the experiments easily without installing any packages. You can view and run the code on: https://codeocean.com/capsule/0220918/tree/v1

## Overview
`LDGCNN` is the improved version of Dynamic Graph CNN. We have evaluated our network on the point cloud classification dataset (ModelNet40) and segementation dataset (ShapeNet):

* Classification accuracy on the ModelNet40: **92.9%**.
* Mean IoU on the ShapeNet: **85.1%**

## Requirements
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* h5py
```bash
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
sudo pip install h5py
```

## Point cloud classification
### Dataset 

* ModelNet40 dataset is downloaded automatically through the `provider.py`.


* We upload our pretrained model, you can evaluate the performance of our network directly by running the evaluation script:
``` bash
python evaluate.py
```
* Run the training script:
``` bash
python train.py
```

## Point cloud segmentation

Enter the "part_seg" file folder.

### Dataset 
Load the data for part segmentation.
```
sh +x download_data.sh
```

### Evaluation
We upload our trained model. You can evaluate the trained model by running: 
```
python test.py
```

### Train
Train the model on 2 GPUs, each with 12 GB memeory. 
```
python train_multi_gpu.py
```
Model parameters with the highest validation accuracy are saved in "log/ldgcnn_seg.ckpt*".
